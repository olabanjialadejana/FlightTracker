## Overview

FlightTracker attempts to help customers find the most affordable flights to their dream vacation destinations. Whether you're a globetrotter or just planning your next getaway or even relocating soon, it just works for you!!!.

## Key Features

### User Registration

Users initially register on FlightTracker, and provide essential information to tailor flight recommendations to their preferences. The registration process captures the following details:

- **Home City**: Where you're departing from.
- **Vacation City**: Your desired destination.
- **Estimated Departure and Arrival Times**: When you plan to travel.
- **Airfare Budget**: Your preferred price range for flights.

### Personalized Flight Recommendations

Once registered, customers will receive personalized email notifications with the cheapest available flights matching their criteria. 

## Technical Details

Behind the scenes, our FlightTracker uses Google Sheets as a temporary database to store customer information. While this approach is effective for the current version, we are continuously working to enhance and expand our database capabilities for a more robust user experience.
Also, it is currently a command-line application. However, a web-interface will be designed for its front-end.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to extend our gratitude to the Tequila Platform for providing the essential API for flight searches and supporting us in delivering a comprehensive flight tracking experience to our users.

Thank you for choosing the Flight Tracker App. Start planning your dream vacation today!
